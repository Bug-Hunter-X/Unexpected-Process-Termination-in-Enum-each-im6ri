This repository demonstrates a common Elixir error involving the unexpected termination of a process within an Enum.each loop. The `bug.ex` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.ex` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from using `Process.exit/2` inside the anonymous function, which abruptly halts the iteration and can lead to unexpected behavior in larger applications. The solution involves restructuring the code to avoid abrupt termination while still achieving the intended logic.
